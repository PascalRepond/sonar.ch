After the successful conclusion of the SONAR development project, the service is ready for its go-live and does so with its very first client : [Haute école pédagogique du Valais](http://www.hepvs.ch/). As RERO+ has been officially established as a private foundation, this is an exciting time to get a glimpse into the future of SONAR.

## From the project...

Part of the P-5 program (Scientific information: access, processing and safeguarding) of [swissuniversities](https://www.swissuniversities.ch/), SONAR was developed in order to provide a national platform for Swiss open access scientific publications. Four partners from all language areas of Switzerland collaborated during two years to carry out the project: [RERO](https://www.rero.ch/), [HES-SO](https://www.hes-so.ch/) / [HEG Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/heg/), [FH Graubünden](https://www.fhgr.ch/), [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/).

## ...to the services

SONAR is an Institutionnal Repository as a Service with [two distinct services](https://about.sonar.ch/iraas/). Both contain these main features: publication deposit and validation, search, display, configuration and Switch edu-ID login. The software has been publicly tested by institutions throughout Switzerland and subsequently improved. Their operation and business model are well established and known by RERO+ thanks to their experience with [RERO DOC](https://doc.rero.ch/), with the most important novelties of SONAR being its multi-tenant infrastructure in the cloud in four national languages, built with the latest version of Invenio.

- **Dedicated portal:** This service can host any type of digital library, not necessarliy open access. This type of portal benefits from an extended customer support and can be extensively customized by the client with its own visual identity as well as specific metadata fields. The [Haute école pédagogique du Valais](lien vers le portail dédié) uses this service and is SONAR's first client to go live.

- **Shared portal:** This service is available for Swiss institutions that need to host their open access publications. Less expensive but less customizable, this service offers a visibility of scholarly publications through a global portal and creates a dedicated collection for the client institution. This global portal is available at [Sonar.ch](https://sonar.ch/) and acts as a national open access repository. It aggregates all Swiss OA publications through content tracking and harvests their metadata from national and international repositories to create a centralized database. For each document with a full-text, a link to the source server (usually, the repository or the editor's website) is available.

## The future

Two other institutions chose SONAR as the solution for their institutional archive, also preferring the dedicated option:
- [Università della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/) 
- [HEP-BEJUNE](https://www.hep-bejune.ch/).

In parallel to these two migration projects, RERO+ continues to ensure the ongoing development of the solution.
