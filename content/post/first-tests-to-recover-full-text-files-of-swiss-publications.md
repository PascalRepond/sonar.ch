On the 3rd of April took place a common working meeting of the 4 SONAR partners (HES-SO/HEG Genève, HTW Chur, USI and RERO) in Bern.

HEG Genève is conducting a feasibility study of ways of recovering full-text files of Swiss publications, having achieved some important conclusions.

Experiments tried the following process (see the animated GIF below):

1. Harvest metadata from third parties to cover as many publications as possible (Crossref was tested in a first step)
2. Take the subset of them containing affiliations
	1. Among them, select publications related to Swiss research institutions
    2. Among them, check if they are OA (Unpaywall was tested)
    3. Recover the full-text file
3. Take the subset of them without affiliations  (still work in progress)
    1. Among them, search Swiss affiliations or reference to SNF funding (Medline was tested)
    2. Among them, check if they are OA (Unpaywall was tested)
    3. Recover the full-text file
