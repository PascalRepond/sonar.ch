## Future Services

Besides collecting publications and metadata from external sources, it also serves as a deposit for directly hosting publications from interested academic institutions (Institutional Repository as a Service - IRaaS). This kind of service will be provided in two distinct forms: either as a shared, multi-institutional interface, or as dedicated independent instances, each with their own distinct identity.

				<h2>Future Services</h2>
				<h3>IRaaS &ndash; Institutional Repository as a Service</h3>
				This kind of service will be provided in two distinct forms:
				<ul>
					<li>As a <strong>shared, multi-institutional portal</strong>, with a single common search and navigation interface, as well as common self-archiving policies and metadata schemes. The contents of each institution are distinguished by means of collections, navigation paths in the search interface (facets) as well as some visual customization at the document level.<br>
					[Scheduled for mid-2019]</li>
					<li>As <strong>dedicated independent portals</strong>, each with their own distinct identity and policies.<br>
					[Scheduled for 2020]</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Schedule</h2>
				<h3>2018-2020</h3>
				During this period, SONAR takes the form of a <a href="/project/">project</a>. In the meantime, it will progressively  give rise to full-fledged durable services.
				<h3>Mid-2019</h3>
				The first version of SONAR, namely its IRaaS component, will be operational in the course of 2019, taking over and improving the current service already provided by <a href="https://doc.rero.ch/">RERO&nbsp;DOC</a>, with a renewed and improved version of the service that it currently provides.
